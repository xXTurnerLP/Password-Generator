# Password-Generator

You can choose password difficulty levels from 1 to 4. After that a password is generated for you and is saved in a file called "generated_passwords.txt" in the file's root directory.

+ It has ZIP with already compiled binaries for 64 and 32 bit machines. If that doesn't work for you, you can compile it yourself in the VS folder is all you need.
